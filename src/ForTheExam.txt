Notes given to be aware of for the exam:

Code Formatting:
    - when you do see the line number 1 or no line numbers at all, you have to make sure imports aren't missing!
    - Exam save space by merging code on the same line
    - When no line numbers / main method exist assume the imports and other methods outside of scope of the question
        is correct, unless stated otherwise.
